# ISE_Project_Portfolio
Caleb Woessner and Brennan Lawler's Stock Portfolio Optimization Project

The objective of this project is to maximize the return on investment for a stock portfolio, given 20 different stocks with associated annual returns and risks. In this scenario, we want to create a diverse portfolio of stocks to optimize our one-year returns and reduce the potential risk; therefore, we will choose 5 stocks to equally invest our budget in. We chose a budget of $10,000 to be allocated with 20% ($2,000) in each stock. To reduce risk, we are limiting the average risk for the 5 stocks to be 0.11 (or 11%). In conclusion, our goal is to choose the 5 stocks, while minimizing the average risk to 11% with a diverse portfolio, that will maximize the one-year return on our investment budget of $10,000.
